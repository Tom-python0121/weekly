A collection of 3182 classic 88x31 buttons from the 1990’s, 2000’s, and today in GIF format. I try to update this page regularly. Feel free to copy buttons to your website, but avoid hot-linking if possible.

**Why we need to stop using React**  
https://sredmond.medium.com/why-we-need-to-stop-using-react-1ae3ec7959a4  
Before we even get started I can already hear you pounding away at your keyboards writing your angry response. I would ask that you read my full explanation before going off at me in the comments. I really want to emphasize that I’m not trying to attack you personally because you use React or like React. However, what I am trying to say is that I think that React leaves a lot to be desired. What I want to do is explore the pain points and detail why I think React is an overall flawed library.

**I miss the old internet**

Is it just me or is today's internet boring and overly commercialized? I feel like today's internet is like a modern mall, sterile and boring with just main-brand clothing stores, a food court, and not a lot else. Whereas I feel like the old internet was more like an exciting urban playground. First off, yes, I know that the old internet was dial-up and you could get kicked off if someone picked up the phone. I also know it was much slower. I lived through it. I was in middle school when my dad got the internet in the mid 1990s, probably about 1995-96?

**软件幻灭**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/100662403  
我们今天所在的地方是糟糕的。作为工程师，我们有能力也应该做得更好。我们应该有更好的工具，我们应该构建更好的应用，更快，更可预测，更可靠，资源消耗更低（低几个数量级！）。我们应该深入理解我们在做什么以及为什么要做。我们可靠、可预测、最高质量的交付。我们有能力也应该为我们的工作感到自豪。我们不应该只是“交付我们已有的。。。“，没有但是！Releated: [Surprisingly Slow](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/06/surprisingly-slow/), [I can only think that modern front end development has failed](https://twitter.com/antirez/status/1378272801522597888) 及相关讨论： https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26689239 

**语义化表达 —— 构建类型优先的交互体系**  
https://www.yuque.com/xufei-coder/code/fhoks9  
近几年，随着 TypeScript 的逐步流行，类型系统逐渐被前端这个群体重视起来，也逐渐在一些组件库中被深度采用。但是，我们可以发现，如果从使用类型系统的几个层级去划分：类型不友好，类型友好，类型优先。几乎所有组件库都处于前两个层级，并未达到类型优先的程度。那么，什么是类型优先，它有什么好处，本文尝试结合一些具体案例，给出说明。

**CSS is a Strongly Typed Language**  
https://css-tricks.com/css-is-a-strongly-typed-language/  
[CSS is a declarative, domain-specific programming language](https://notlaura.com/css-is-a-programming-language/). It is also strongly typed. For the most part, values in CSS stay declared as authored. If a value is invalid the browser throws the entire property away.

**What Saul Bass Can Teach Us About Web Design**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/saul-bass-teach-web-design/  
Film credits, brand logos, posters… Saul Bass did it all, and the principles that informed his work are just as valuable now as they were 50 years ago.

**Organic, Homegrown HTML**

Despite increasing leniency on frameworks being the only way to build for the web1, hand-written HTML never disappeared and I feel is still a perfectly suitable way to build a personal website.

**The web is something different**  
https://daverupert.com/2021/02/the-web-is-something-different/  
To be clear, I hate the “The web is for documents” take as much as I hate the “I build web apps, not websites” take as much as the “The web is a compile target” take as much as I hate the “The web has to compete with native apps” take. Those takes always seem to end up as some kind of scaffolding for a pissing contest, an attempt to denigrate someone else’s line of work.

**Complexity Explained**  
https://complexityexplained.github.io/
Complexity science, also called complex systems science, studies how a large collection of components – locally interacting with each other at small scales – can spontaneously self-organize to exhibit non-trivial global structures and behaviors at larger scales, often without external intervention, central authorities or leaders. The properties of the collection may not be understood or predicted from the full knowledge of its constituents alone. Such a collection is called a complex system and it requires new mathematical frameworks and scientific methodologies for its investigation.

**How to hire senior developers: Give them more autonomy**  
https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/autonomy/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26027448  
If we agree with Naur’s assessment of programming, what follows is that the value of a high tech company is inseparably interwoven with the development team, and the model of the problem domain in their heads. What this means, in essence: The main value of a software company is the mapping of source code and problem space in the developer’s heads. This conclusion has important consequences for many aspects of a software company, but especially for management, hiring and overall culture.

**Maximizing Developer Effectiveness**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html  
Technology is constantly becoming smarter and more powerful. I often observe that as these technologies are introduced an organization’s productivity instead of improving has reduced. This is because the technology has increased complexities and cognitive overhead to the developer, reducing their effectiveness. In this article, the first of a series, I introduce a framework for maximizing developer effectiveness. Through research I have identified key developer feedback loops, including micro-feedback loops that developers do 200 times a day. These should be optimized so they are quick, simple and impactful for developers. I will examine how some organizations have used these feedback loops to improve overall effectiveness and productivity.
