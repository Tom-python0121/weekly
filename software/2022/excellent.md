**A career ending mistake**  
https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/career  
By “the end”, I don't necessarily mean picking your retirement date. What we're really talking about is the aim or goal of your career. Where will you be when you realise that this is where you've always wanted to be? If you love what you're doing now and don't ever want to change jobs, great: you've reached the end of your career, even if it plays out over many decades. If you don't love it, and that's much more likely, then it's worth asking what would make you feel that way, and when it's going to happen. So, where do you want to end up? And is that where you're currently heading? If not, what should you do about it?

**Thoughts On Markdown**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/thoughts-on-markdown/  
Markdown in all its flavors, interpretations, and forks won’t go away. However, it’s important to look at emerging content formats that try to encompass modern needs. In this article, Knut shares his advice against Markdown by looking back on why it was introduced in the first place, and by going through some of the major developments of content on the web.

**What are the Most Important Statistical Ideas of the Past 50 Years?**  
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1938081  
We review the most important statistical ideas of the past half century, which we categorize as: counterfactual causal inference, bootstrapping and simulation-based inference, overparameterized models and regularization, Bayesian multilevel models, generic computation algorithms, adaptive decision analysis, robust inference, and exploratory data analysis. We discuss key contributions in these subfields, how they relate to modern computing and big data, and how they might be developed and extended in future decades. The goal of this article is to provoke thought and discussion regarding the larger themes of research in statistics and data science.

2022 年已经到来，我们是时候反思 Web 开发中的种种过时软件、炒作歪曲和荒谬趋势了。把握这一年，我们也该重新专注于性能与技术运用，把手段和目的重新统一起来。当然，我不是劝大家用汇编或者 C 语言搞 Web 开发，但关于 JavaScript、Ruby on Rails、Python、Django 以及 PHP 框架的疯狂观点也该消停一下了。另附：[Have Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web? | Transitional Apps with Rich Harris, NYTimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o)。

**web3 is Centralized**

The funny thing is, web3, as it exists today and appears to be building towards, is actually more centralized than the web it seeks to replace. Releated:
